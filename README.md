# CCHS-Prom-2017
DevCatalyst Project: Sydney Wilson, Abbey Allen, and Misty Conaway

  Our client for this website is the CCHS Prom Committee. They do not have a website, therefore we created one. This project's purpose is to inform students at our school about our 2017 Prom. Our website includes information about ticket prices, caterer, entertainment, location, date, time, and directions to the location. 
Our target market is the Juniors and Seniors of CCHS that plan to attend prom this year. The client wanted a few photos of the location. We also included some photo links to the caterer, entertainment, and directions. The only color the client specified was gold to fit into their 24K Magic theme. The prom committee did not have any social media accounts for this prom.

  One of our biggest achievements with our website was getting our title photo to fit nicely on the page. We chose to keep our background white with black text to accent the gold in an elegant manner. Next, we chose a basic cursive font because it looks tasteful and easy to read.
